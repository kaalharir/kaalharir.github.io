  abstract: In the era of modern technology, React is a popular platform to develop web applications' front-end. Half of the application code is for the front-end. Testing on the front-end or GUI can be done manually and automated. In modern application development, React is known as a very popular framework for single-page web applications. Just as any application development, testing the GUI of such React application also needs to be done properly. In modern development practices, like agile development or CI/CD development, testing performance and the easiness of implementing testing tools are crucial factors. In our research work, we have run three different testing tools, Jest, Enzyme, and Cypress, specifically designed for React-based single-page applications. Our main focus is to check the execution time for the same testing functionality on different tools and what should be taken into account for those tools to integrate with projects and the friendliness of the tools for the tester. Each tool was found to be useful for its unique benefits; however, for development like Agile or CI/CD, we found that Enzyme is a better tool, which is both easy to integrate while providing efficiency.

  abstract: The development of software-based systems often deals with unexpected challenges. A risk management plan can positively contribute to dealing with such challenges. The paper conducted an online-based survey on Bangladesh based software firms to understand the current scenario of implementing risk management for software development projects. The survey was done as an attempt to gather information about the standards and practices along with the challenges faced by the practitioners. The response analysis indicates that even though implementing risk management is convenient for a project’s success, there are some challenges which often lead to unwillingness of risk management implementation. The paper proposes some suggestions based on the survey responses to encourage the Bangladeshi software firms to implement risk management practices and utilize its opportunities for a successful software project development.

  abstract: ERP, known as Enterprise Resource Planning is a software which is designed to build a whole business solution that supports all of a company’s primary functions. This is commonly used by business in developed countries. Customers want a more tailored marketing experience based on their demands, behavior and interests. The ERP implementation process is a bit complicated, and it takes a thorough understanding of basic implementation stages. Though the implementation partner is there to assist, communication and responsibility sharing can be difficult. The main target of this paper is to build a handbook and provide the value driven data for an organization and its customers that explains all of the implementation processes. Six interviews were conducted. An implementation guide was discussed and problems were sorted out. At the conclusion, a methodology model diagram is proposed.
