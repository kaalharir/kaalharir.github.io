<h2><b>Research</b> Experience</h2>
</div>
<hr/>
<h7 style="text-align: justify;">My primary research field revolves around Software Engineering, focusing on developing efficient and reliable software solutions. Despite advancements in this field, challenges persist, particularly in ensuring the adaptability of software across various platforms and addressing scalability issues. Deploying sophisticated software in resource-constrained environments poses another significant challenge, which motivates my research to find innovative solutions.
<br/>I am also passionate about exploring how software applications can contribute to societal well-being. This involves investigating the development of software tools and systems that can address real-world challenges and improve people's lives. My research interests span areas such as automated testing, software maintenance, and the application of agile methodologies in software development. 
<br/>Having authored several research papers on these topics, including "Automated GUI Testing Tools for Single Page Web Applications" and "A Novel Approach to Overcome Challenges in Requirement Prioritization," my work aims to make valuable contributions to the field of Software Engineering. I am committed to advancing the understanding of software development practices, challenges, and opportunities, ultimately contributing to the creation of more resilient and user-friendly software solutions.</h7>
